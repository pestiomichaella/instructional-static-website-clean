## Overview

Turning is the fundamental process of removing material from the outer diameter of a workpiece to produce a cylindrical shape. This is the most common operation performed on a lathe.

## Types of Turning

### Straight Turning
Removing material along the external surface to reduce diameter uniformly.

### Taper Turning
Cutting a conical shape into the workpiece by adjusting the angle of the cutting tool.

### Contour Turning
Shaping the workpiece into a complex profile using a specially shaped cutting tool.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure the workpiece in the chuck or between centers, ensuring it is properly aligned with the spindle axis.
2. Install the appropriate turning tool in the tool post and set the cutting edge at the center height of the workpiece.
3. Select the proper spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut accordinig to the workpiece material and tool specifications.
4. Start the machine and bring the tool gradually into contact with the rotating workpiece.
5. Perform roughing passes to reduce the workpiece diameter to near the desired size, maintaining a steady feed.
6. Perform one or more finishing passes with reduced depth of cut and appropriate feed to achieve the required final dimension and surface finish.
7. Stop the machine and measure the workpiece diameter using suitable measuring instruments (e.g., micrometer).
8. Make any necessary adjustments and repeat finishing passes if required.

## Tips for Success

- Always ensure the workpiece is securely held before starting
- Make multiple light passes rather than one heavy pass
- Keep the tool sharp for better results
- Use appropriate cutting speeds for the material
