## Overview

Facing involves cutting the end of the workpiece to produce a flat surface. It's often the first operation performed on a lathe to create a clean, flat starting point for further machining.

## Purpose of Facing

- Create a clean, flat surface for subsequent operations
- Establish a reference surface for measurements
- Prepare the workpiece for drilling or turning operations
- Remove surface irregularities

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Mount the workpiece securely in the chuck so that the end to be faced is accessible.
2. Install a facing tool in the tool post and set the tool tip at the center height of the workpiece.
3. Select appropriate spindle speed and feed rate based on material and tool recommendations.
4. Start the spindle and position the tool near the outer edge of the workpiece end face.
5. Feed the tool gradually towards the center of the rotating workpiece using the cross-slide to remove material across the face.
6. Repeat passes as needed until the entire face is flat and the required length is achieved.
7. Stop the machine and verify flatness and length using appropriate measuring tools.

## Key Points

- The tool must be precisely at center height
- Feed the tool steadily from the edge toward the center
- Multiple light passes produce better results than one heavy pass
- Check flatness with a straightedge after completion
