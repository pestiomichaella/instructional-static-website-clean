## Overview

Parting, also known as cutting off, is the process of cutting a piece off a workpiece while it is rotating on a lathe. This operation uses a narrow, blade-like cutting tool positioned perpendicular to the workpiece.

## Applications

- Trim ends of workpieces
- Cut finished parts from longer stock
- Separate multiple parts from a single bar
- Create distinct sections for further processing

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Mount the workpiece in the chuck with sufficient length extending for the parting operation.
2. Install the parting tool in the tool post, ensuring that it is perpendicular to the workpiece axis and set at center height.
3. Select a relatively low to moderate spindle speed, according to material and tool recommendations.
4. Start the spindle and position the parting tool at the desired cutting location.
5. Feed the tool gradually into the rotating workpiece using a steady and controlled motion.
6. Apply cutting fluid, if appropriate, to improve tool life and surface finish.
7. Continue feeding until the workpiece is nearly cut through, then reduce feed to avoid sudden separation.
8. Allow the separated part to fall safely or support it, stop the machine, and deburr the cut surfaces.

## Safety and Precautions

- Feed the tool slowly and steadily
- Avoid sudden pressure spikes
- Be aware of the cut-off piece becoming free
- Ensure adequate clearance for the falling part
- Never reach toward the parting tool
