## Overview

Taper turning is the process of creating a conical shape on a workpiece. This operation is performed by adjusting the tailstock or compound rest at an angle.

## Applications

- Tool holders
- Machine tapers
- Shaft tapers
- Cone shapes

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure the workpiece in the chuck or between centers and prepare a reference cylindrical surface if necessary.
2. Calculate the taper angle or half-angle based on the desired taper dimensions.
3. Swivel/rotate the compound rest to the calculated angle relative to the lathe axis and lock it in position.
4. Install the appropriate turning tool and set the tool tip at center height.
5. Select suitable spindle speed and feed rate.
6. Start the spindle and position the tool at the larger-diameter end of the taper.
7. Feed the tool along the length of the workpiece using the compound rest, thereby generating the tapered surface.
8. Make successive passes with gradual infeed until the required taper dimensions and surface finish are achieved.
9. Stop the machine and verify the taper using measuring instruments such as calipers, micrometers, or a taper gauge.

## Methods

- **Tailstock Offset Method**: Move tailstock to create angle
- **Compound Rest Method**: Rotate compound rest to desired angle
- **Attachment Method**: Use taper turning attachment

## Precision Points

- Calculate taper angle accurately
- Verify angle with taper gauge
- Make light passes for accuracy
- Check taper frequently
