## Overview

Grooving involves creating narrow grooves or channels on a workpiece. A specific grooving tool is carefully fed into the workpiece while it rotates on the lathe.

## Applications

- O-ring seats for hydraulic systems
- Oil grooves for lubrication
- Snap ring grooves
- Decorative grooves

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure the workpiece in the chuck with the groove location clearly identified or measured.
2. Install the grooving tool of the required width in the tool post and set the cutting edge at center height.
3. Select appropriate spindle speed and feed rate based on the material and tool.
4. Start the spindle and position the tool at the required groove location.
5. Feed the tool radially into the rotating workpiece in small increments until the desired depth is reached.
6. If a wider groove is needed, traverse the tool slightly along the workpiece axis to obtain the specified width.
7. Retract the tool, stop the machine, and verify the groove dimensions using appropriate measuring tools.

## Important Considerations

- Groove depth must be precise
- Width is determined by tool size
- Multiple passes may be needed for deep grooves
- Use proper cutting fluid for better results
- Measure groove dimensions carefully
