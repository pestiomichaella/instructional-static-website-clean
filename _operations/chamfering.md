## Overview

Chamfering involves cutting a bevel or angled edge on the workpiece. On a lathe, this is achieved by positioning the cutting tool at an angle to the workpiece's edge.

## Purpose

- Remove sharp edges for safety
- Prepare parts for fitting
- Improve aesthetics
- Facilitate assembly

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Mount the workpiece securely in the chuck and identify the edge or shoulder where the chamfer is required.
2. Install a chamfering tool or adjust a turning tool to the desired chamfer angle (commonly 45 degrees).
3. Set the tool tip at center height and select appropriate spindle speed.
4. Start the spindle and position the tool at the edge of the workpiece.
5. Feed the tool gradually into the workpiece at the set angle to produce the chamfer of the specified length or dimension.
6. Retract the tool, stop the machine, and verify the chamfer size using suitable measuring devices.

## Guidelines

- Standard chamfer angle is typically 45 degrees
- Keep the angle consistent
- Maintain proper tool height
- Use light pressure
- Verify angle and size after completion
