<!-- # Vertical Turret Lathe (VTL) -->

The Vertical Turret Lathe (VTL) is another term used to describe a vertical lathe, emphasizing its vertical spindle and tool-holding turret. This configuration is essential for handling very large, heavy components found in sectors like aerospace and shipbuilding. VTLs can perform high-precision operations, including boring, turning, and facing, on massive parts with maximum stability.
