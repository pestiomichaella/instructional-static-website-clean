<!-- # Speed Lathe -->

The Speed Lathe features a simpler design that includes a powerful, high-speed spindle but lacks a lead screw or gear box. This type of lathe is primarily used for finishing, polishing, and sanding operations, rather than deep material removal. It focuses on high-speed rotation to achieve a superior surface finish. Speed lathes are particularly useful in applications like metal polishing and certain stages of woodturning where surface quality is paramount.
