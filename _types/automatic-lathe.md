<!-- # Automatic Lathe -->

An Automatic Lathe is engineered for unsupervised mass production. Once loaded, these lathes are designed to perform a series of operations autonomously, including automatically changing tools and feeding new workpiece material. This high level of automation makes them exceptionally efficient for producing large quantities of standardized parts, such as fasteners and fittings, with minimal operator intervention.
