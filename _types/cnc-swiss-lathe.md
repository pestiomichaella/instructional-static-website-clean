<!-- # CNC Swiss-Type Lathe -->

The CNC Swiss-Type Lathe is a specialized form of CNC lathe that excels at manufacturing long, slender, and highly accurate turned parts. Its core design principle is supporting the material very close to the cutting tool using a guide bushing. This support prevents the thin material from bending or vibrating, ensuring superior precision for small, complex items used in fields like medical device manufacturing and watchmaking.
