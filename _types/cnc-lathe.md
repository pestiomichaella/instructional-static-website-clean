<!-- # CNC Lathe -->

CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Lathe is a modern machine run by a computer program. A computer precisely directs the tool movements, allowing it to produce complex shapes and highly accurate parts repeatedly. This reliance on programming makes it the machine of choice for high-volume mass production where consistent quality is essential. CNC lathes are highly efficient and reduce the potential for human error.
