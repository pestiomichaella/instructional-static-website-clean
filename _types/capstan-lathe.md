# Capstan Lathe

Capstan Lathes are similar in function to turret lathes but are generally used for smaller components and faster operation. They feature a sliding drum, or capstan, that holds the tools and facilitates quick, easy changes. This design ensures precision and efficiency for medium to large-scale production work. Capstan lathes are favored when a specific sequence of short operations must be repeated quickly.
