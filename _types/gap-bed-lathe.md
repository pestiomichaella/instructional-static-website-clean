# Gap Bed Lathe

The Gap Bed Lathe is designed with a unique feature: a section of the bed near the headstock that can be removed. This removable gap allows the machine to accommodate and spin workpieces with a much larger diameter than a standard lathe of the same size. This adaptability makes the gap bed lathe a versatile choice for general-purpose machining where material sizes often vary.
